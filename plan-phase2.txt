Fix "train" button being visible after reload on a skill currently being trained

Fix region travel progress not loading

Fix action button being visible after reload on an action currently being executed

Fix slowdown when repeatedly saving and loading

Save state of the application in a cookie so it's not lost if the player closes the tab

Add a button to reset the save state.

Fix problem where reloading the page sets the time for behaviours to a much higher value than it should be (loading by button press works fine)
This is because time counts from the moment the page loads - it's not using actual times. See:
https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/DOMHighResTimeStamp#The_time_origin
https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/window/requestAnimationFrame

Fix bug where cookies don't persist when tab is closed - WONTFIX, is due to running locally through file

Ability training buttons should not be visible when loading during training

Automatically save the game

Automatically load the game if a saveState exists on first page load.

Have the log cut off after 50 items.

Add a button to delete the cookie and start over
