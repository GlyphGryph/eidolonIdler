Monster classes and governing stats:

Each stat is fed by the following:
Power: Passion, Strength
Will: Faith, Persistence
Intellect: Fear, Cunning
Bond: pure Spirit



Player can choose 1 of 3 starting monsters, or decline to get a fourth monster.

Helcule: Power-based Monster
Watua: Will-based Monster
Pixi: Intellect-based Monster

Sapine: Bond-based Monster 

Players can choose to capture defeated bosses or devour them. Devouring them grants a big bonus in resources, and adds their ability table to your own to learn, and raises your max stat level for the governing attribute, but raises your monsters Chaos stat as well. It also changes your monster's appearance.

Capturing them allows you to have an additional monster that can do things at the same time as your main monster.

You're best off capturing some and devouring others.


The basic stats at this point are:

POWER - How effective the Monsters abilities are, increasing it by 1 level increases the damage healed by Shared Healing by one per point of Spirit.
WILL - How resilient the Monster is, increases Health and Defenses.
INTELLECT - How many abilities the Monster can have enabled at once.
BOND

Upgrading any of these stats (except Bond, which has already been maxxed) also adds a new Untrained ability to the ability list, Basic Attack (unused in Phase 1, but very useful immediately afterwards since it lets player fight a Boss Monster dealing damage equal to POWER), Tenacious Hunter (bonus spirit gain from hunting), and Assist (a monster ability that makes the player action run faster while it's active and the monster is not doing anything else).


Intro:

Player sees an old man sprite against a black background page, who offers him the choice of the three monsters above, or the option to reject his offer. If reject is chosen, he asks twice if you're sure. Then he says he insists you pick one of the available monsters. If you reject another time he tells you will regret your choice, and then the monsters blink out one by one and then so does he. After a short while staring at blackness, the bond-based monster will appear.

Once the player has a monster, a gif of footsteps against a stone floor plays. Then a view of a cave, with the orphan jumping with joy and the chosen monster beside him. Then the screen shakes once, twice, three times, and the image transforms to the monster being impaled by a giant leg and the orphan looking shocked. Cuts to image of the sun behind a giant shadow figure, which gets hazy and wavy as things fade to darkness. Show image of monster coalescing out of the players unconscious body, fade out, and then the standard UI fades in.
