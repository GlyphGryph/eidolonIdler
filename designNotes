Monster classes and governing stats:

Each stat is fed by the following:
Power: Passion, Strength
Will: Faith, Persistence
Intellect: Fear, Cunning
Bond: pure Spirit



Player can choose 1 of 3 starting monsters, or decline to get a fourth monster.

Helcule: Power-based Monster
Watua: Will-based Monster
Pixi: Intellect-based Monster

Sapine: Bond-based Monster 

Players can choose to capture defeated bosses or devour them. Devouring them grants a big bonus in resources, and adds their ability table to your own to learn, and raises your max stat level for the governing attribute, but raises your monsters Chaos stat as well. It also changes your monster's appearance.

Capturing them allows you to have an additional monster that can do things at the same time as your main monster.

You're best off capturing some and devouring others.
