Add a button that triggers "interrupt" and another that releases it

Make sure interrupt status is saved

Add "interrupt" logic for running action timers that freezes timer progression when a state variable interrupted=true.

Add interrupt logic to training abilities

Add interrupt logic to travel

Do not allow players to trigger new actions, training, or travel, or to upgrade stats, while interrupted.

Disable all such buttons.

Change interrupt button to "Summon Boss".

When someone summons the boss, there's a popover that appears that says BOSS FIGHT.

Add "Boss [boss monster] Ambushed [blah]" and have Blah be the first monster.

Make sure the monsters and enemies are being tracked.

Save and load the current setup of the battle.

Add three buttons: Win, Lose, Escape

If Escape is pressed, the popover disappears and the BOSS FIGHT ends, as well as the interruption

If Lose is pressed, as in Escape except the monster is "destroyed".

When a monster is destroyed, cancel any existing actions or training for that monster.

On the monster page, and after their name on the action page, say "Destroyed".

Add a button "Summon Boss Against Team", which has the same popup except it says the Boss vs list of team members.

Add a button "Summon Boss Against Team", which has the same popup except it says the Boss vs list of team members.

If Escape is pressed, as before. 

If Lose is pressed, process loss for entire team.

When a monster is destroyed, add a ressurect action to the monsters action list that is NOT disabled.

When the ressurection action completes, the monster is no longer destroyed, but the player character is diminished by an amount equal to the total level of all the monster's stats except Bond.

For a destroyed monster, disable actions (except ressurect), stat upgrades, and training. This does NOT disable travel.

When a player is diminished, cancel any existing actions for that player and any traveling.

For a diminished players, disable actions and cancel/disable travel.

If Lose is n pressed, the player is Diminished: 30, with all the above diminishing stuff still happening.

In any situation, when the Win button is pressed, a new popover screen becomes visible that says Victory!

In it, for each monster on the players screen, there is the option to "Consume Soul".

Consuming a soul gives the player a significant amount of Spirit.

Add "domesticMonsterDefinitions", which have an id.

When a domestic monster is created, have a "primaryDefinitionId" that references the definition id.

Add a "GenericMonster" MonsterDefinition and link it to both domestic monsters.

Add "rampantMonsterDefinitions", which have a type with one of two values: 'boss', and 'minion'.

Each boss fight should be associated with a MonsterDefinition - add two, "Monster Boss" and "Monster Minion".

The Summon Boss button starts the fight against the Monster Boss.

A Summon Minion button starts the fight against the Monster Minion.

MonsterDefinitions of the Boss type also have a "domesticId". Link the Monster boss to the GenericMonster.

Add a button to Summon Ambush which starts a fight between a random monster or the player character and the "Monster Minion".

If the monster was a Boss type monster, consuming the soul adds a "secondaryDefinitionId" to the monster assuming one does not already exist.

Add display for current templates on monster info page

Consuming a Boss soul adds the abilities from the MonsterDefinition to the consuming monster's lockedAbilities unless it already exists in lockedAbilities or unlockedAbilities.

If the monster was a Minion type monster, only gain some Spirit.

---

There is also the option "Bind Soul" if the character is present in a Boss fight.

Bind Soul creates a new monster on the player's team based on the MonsterDefinition.

When a player is present in a Minion Fight, they only get the option to "leave remnant" which does nothing.

Mark some actions as "risky". Implement "automatic ambushes" that has a chance to summon a minion against monsters or players that are currently engaged in an action that is considered "risky".

Associate a boss monster and minion monster with a region, and add one for Tangled Jungle and Burnt Village.

Have ambushes pull from the current regions minion monster.

Add a "boss available" variable to regions. Set the barren region wasteland to false, and the Tangled Jungle and Burnt Village to true.

When a region is at 100% explored, add a "Fight Boss" button to the region controls if the boss is available, that works like the Summon Boss button and pulls from the regions boss monster.

When a boss has been defeated, mark that region is boss no longer available.

Cancel ambushes if boss monster is not available.
